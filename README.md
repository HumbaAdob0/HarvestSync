HarvestSync is a web-based platform that connects farmers and sellers to improve agricultural market efficiency. The system allows farmers to input their estimated harvest quantities in advance, while sellers and distributors can place pre-orders based on those projections.

By aggregating and analyzing regional supply data, HarvestSync helps balance the distribution of goods between areas with surplus and those with shortages, preventing price imbalances where oversupply drives prices down in one region and scarcity drives prices up in another.
